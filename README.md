**An experiment in collaborative, multi-dimensional idea scoring in the browser.** For example, characterize _features_ versus _objectives_ or _features_ versus _initiatives_. Each dimension is assumed to be hierarchical, for example, _Increase Revenue Predictability > Sell More to Existing Customers > Make Demos Easier_.

_So far, it only builds dynamic tables with hierarchical column and row headers._
